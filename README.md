# Write Yourself a Git in Rust

A simplified git implementation in Rust. This project follows [a guide written by Thibault Polge](https://wyag.thb.lt/) (which uses Python).

This project was created solely for the edification of its author and is not intended for serious use. I do not recommend trying it on any repository that has not been fully backed up.
